Steps to create react app from scratch
-> create html file
-> create a js file
-> link tha js file to html
-> add a div and give it some id like root
-> add react cdn or install it by npm later. after configure npm in the project.
-> createElement on Js File 
-> create root and pass id root of html page div here
-> const mainDiv = ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById("root"))
-> render or root.render(mainDiv);
-> configure git -> git init -> crate README.md file
-> initial commit code
-> connect to github repo
-> push the code to github
-> configute npm -> npm init
-> a package.json will be added to project folder
-> now we can install packages or we can add dependencies in our project
-> first we install bundler 
   why becoz our whole code including (html, css, js) needs to be bundled together 
   or minify or cache or our whole code needs to be clean before send to production
   like webpeck, parcel
-> we are using parcel as dev dependency
there are two types of dependencies one dev dependency and another is normal.
dev dependencies used in development and normal dependencies used in production
becoz we do bundling chunking or minifying in our machine not in server.
so we install it as --dev-save dev dependency npm install parcelk --dev-save
-> now we can add or install react and reactDOM from npm -->


<!-- meaning of  "parcel": "^2.12.0" ^ carrot in front of dependency is
 it will automatically upgrade the package version if there is a minor upgrade -->
 <!-- meaning of  "parcel": "~2.12.0" ~ til operator in front of dependency is
 it will automatically upgrade the package version if there is a major upgrade -->

<!-- -> npm is used to install a package.
-> npx is using to execute a pacakage. -->
